## WCAG 2.1 accessibility issues levels A, AA and AAA
### 1.1 Text Alternatives
### 1.2 Time-based Media
### 1.3 Adaptable
[1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics - Level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/sensory-characteristics.html)

The social media icons shown above have no tooltips or labels. Screenreaders read them, but sighted people will have to know which symbol relates to what, in order to use them.

### 1.4 Distinguishable
### 2.1 Keyboard Accessible
[2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (WCAG 2.1 Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts)

Not tested

### 2.2 Enough Time
### 2.3 Seizures
### 2.4 Navigable
[2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled)

A debatable issue: The title is almost the same as the h1. Should Titles and h1s not be different? h1 could have been more descriptive.

```html
<title>Contact [Institution name] - Canada.ca</title>
<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Contact [Institution name]</h1>
```

### 2.5 Input Modalities
[2.5.4 Motion Actuation (WCAG 2.1 Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation)

NOT tested

### 3.1 Readable
### 3.2 Predictable
### 3.3 Input Assistance
### 4.1 Compatible
