## WCAG 2.1 accessibility issues levels A, AA and AAA
### 1.1 Text Alternatives
[1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html)

Picture placeholders are marked as decorative by using alt=”” and the important information pertaining to their sizes is not provided elsewhere. There are 7 of them.

<img src="2020-assets/GCWeb-ministerial-en_WCAG_2.1_EvaluationNotes/image1.png" alt="image 1"/>

In the actual pages, such pictures are not decorative as well. 

In this case, an alt text saying the size of the picture and what that placeholder is for, might be more meaningful.

### 1.2 Time-based Media
### 1.3 Adaptable
### 1.4 Distinguishable
### 2.1 Keyboard Accessible
[2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (WCAG 2.1 Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts)

Not tested

### 2.2 Enough Time
### 2.3 Seizures
### 2.4 Navigable
[2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled)

A debatable issue: The title is almost the same as the h1. Should Titles and h1s not be different? h1 could have been more descriptive.

```html
<title>Contact [Institution name] - Canada.ca</title>
<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">Contact [Institution name]</h1>
```

[2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) - Level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html)

There is an empty link and its location is indicated in the screenshot below. The screenreader reads it as “blank”.
