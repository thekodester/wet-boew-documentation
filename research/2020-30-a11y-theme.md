## WCAG 2.1 accessibility issues levels A, AA and AAA
### 1.1 Text Alternatives
### 1.2 Time-based Media
### 1.3 Adaptable
[1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/meaningful-sequence)

1.	Tab order: Starts from the menu on the right (Most requested), goes to content (Services and information), then goes to right again (More information for)

* [F1: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to changing the meaning of content by positioning information with CSS](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F1.html)

2.	Within the carousel: The tab order of “Title of destination page – call to action” link comes after the user controls (Right-left arrows, item x of x, pause)

3.	Is presenting social media icons right after h1 a good idea?

[1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics - Level A](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/sensory-characteristics.html)

Social media icons, which are read to screen readers, do not have tooltips. The design assumes that the users know what all these logos stand for.

### 1.4 Distinguishable
[1.4.4 Resize text (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text)

On 200% resize, the carousel has issues.

* [F69: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.4 when resizing visually rendered text up to 200 percent causes the text, image or controls to be clipped, truncated or obscured](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F69.html)

On smaller screens, 200% resize breaks the placeholder of the search field.

[1.4.10 Reflow (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow)

On small screens, content of carousel is dislocated. (Please see 1.4.4 as well.) The text that reads “Item 3 of 3”, as indicated by red arrow, is not perceivable.

### 2.1 Keyboard Accessible
[2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard)

[2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap)

[2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (WCAG 2.1 Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts)

### 2.2 Enough Time
### 2.3 Seizures
### 2.4 Navigable
[2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled)

A debatable issue: The placeholder title used is almost the same as the h1. Should Titles and h1s not be different?

```html
<title>[Theme title] - Canada.ca</title>
<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont">[Theme title]</h1>
```

### 2.5 Input Modalities
[2.5.4 Motion Actuation (WCAG 2.1 Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation)

NOT tested

### 3.1 Readable
### 3.2 Predictable
### 3.3 Input Assistance
### 4.1 Compatible
