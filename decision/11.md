## Issue

There is some ambiguity regarding to what method should be used for resizing text in regard of WCAG 2.0/2.1 Success Criteria 1.4.4.

## Background

- According to WCAG guideline 1.4.4 - Resize Text, text can be resized up to 200% without losing its content or functionality.
- There are two methods of resizing text commonly available into web browsers.
	- Zoom: resizing every contents of the page.
	- Text resize: resizing text only leaving other contents such as image unchanged.

## Support rational

As February 2020 and as defined by the [design decision #2 - Browser supported](2.html) here a quick view of zoom feature supported by those browser.

* Internet Explorer 11: Zoom and provide a text resize specifically for those text-size: Smallest, Smaller, Medium, Larger, Largest
* Firefox: Zoom and text resize in percentage available via the top application menu upon selecting the text-only zoom option which by-pass the other zoom
* Edge: Zoom and don't seem to support text resize
* Chrome: Zoom and text resize available via the "font size" configuration in the Appearance settings with the following value: Very small, Small, Medium (Recommended), Large, Very large
* Safari: Zoom and don't seem to support text resize
* Chrome (mobile): Zoom and text resize available in the accessibility section in the setting, the text size can be adjusted up to 200%.

### Special note regarding WET 4.0.x

* Internet Explorer 11: Text resize don't work since the initial version of WET 4
* Firefox and Chrome: Text resize has caused some issue where some accents and descenders was getting cut when text was oversize to 200%. In particular this was perceptible for value displayed in an HTML select box. Related to [wet-boew issue #7884](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/7884)

## Recommendation

The best practice is to develop content, plugin, template, component, design pattern... that met the Success Criteria 1.4.4 - Resize text by using both methods of resizing text.

When only one of the testing methodology to resize text is used for content, plugin, template, component, design pattern... would be considered sufficient for the requirement to met the Success Criteria 1.4.4
